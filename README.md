### About:
Hi! I am a graduate student at the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, where I am supervised by [Prof. Bhiksha Raj](https://cmu-mlsp.github.io/team/bhiksha_raj)!. I am currently researching in the area of Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

I am broadly interested in machine/deep learning, causality, and information theory. Prior to joining CMU, I was working at MBZUAI with Prof. Jin Tian and Prof. Kun Zhang on causality and machine learning. Please refer to my [CV](file/Ibrahim_Resume_Jan_2025.pdf). (Last updated: January 2025).

<!--I recently worked as a researcher at Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI). During my time at MBZUAI, I worked/collaborated with 
[Prof. Thamar Solorio](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/thamar-solorio/), 
[Prof. Bhiksha Raj](https://cmu-mlsp.github.io/team/bhiksha_raj), and 
[Dr. Hanan Aldarmaki](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/hanan-al-darmaki/)
. Prior to joining MBZUAI, I also worked at several other institutions. For a more detailed description of my background and experience, please refer to my [CV](file/Ibrahim_Resume_Jan_2025.pdf). (Last updated: January 2025)
